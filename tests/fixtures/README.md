# Test Fixtures

This directory contains audio files for testing.

## Adding Test Files

Place sample audio files here for unit testing:

- `test_yellow_track.mp3` - Low-energy track example
- `test_green_track.mp3` - Medium-energy track example
- `test_purple_track.mp3` - High-energy track example

Note: Audio files are gitignored due to size. Developers should add their own test files locally.
